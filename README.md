# My Portfolio

I took this opportunity to showcase my work to the public. In this project, I show exactly where I stand with different technologies and how proficient I feel with each of them. 

As a full stack web developer I feel most proficient in:
* HTML, CSS, and JS
* Vue & Vuetify
* The entire firebase suite
* Git
* Understanding object oriented programming

There are many other languages and libraries I feel comfortable with, and if I don't know them, I am willing to work to understand them.
